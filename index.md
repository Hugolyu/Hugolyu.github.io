# About Me

<img src="https://hugolyu.github.io/honggang.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Honggang Lyu (Hugo, 吕洪港)**.

I am a Ph.D. Student (Year 2) majoring in **Psychiatry and Mental Health** at Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, supervised by [**Dr. Zhongchun Liu**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhongchun-Liu-2). 

Currently, I am a visiting student at the **Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery**, McGill University, co-supervised by [**Dr. Lan Xiong**](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/lan-xiong-md-phd) and [**Dr. Sirui Zhou**](https://szhoulab.github.io/). 

My research focuses on identifying potential risk factors and biomarkers of common psychiatric disorders from a genetic perspective.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *honggang.lv[at]whu[dot]edu[dot]cn*

## Research Interests

> *&ensp;The rapid emergence of high-quality genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for common psychiatric disorders provide insights into for understanding their biological underpinnings. 
> <br> &ensp;However, mental illness manifests with remarkable clinical heterogeneity, with patients exhibiting diverse early clinical symptoms. For example, adolescent depression often presents with mood dysregulation, academic disengagement, and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors, while geriatric depression frequently involves somatic complaints. 
> <br>&ensp;Therefore, identifying potential risk factors and objective biomarkers specific to the early clinical profiles of common psychiatric disorders holds significant value for improving diagnosis and treatment of these debilitating conditions.*

- Conducting large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focused on early-stage psychiatric symptom dimensions in Asian populations. Leveraging population-scale biobanks (e.g., UK Biobank) to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying heterogeneous psychiatric phenotypes.

- Integrating multi-omics data (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, single-cell and bulk RNA-seq) with statistical genetics approaches such as:Mendelian Randomization (MR), Transcriptome-/Proteome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS/PWAS),Genomic Structural Equation Modeling (Genomic SEM) - to identify potential risk factors and biomarkers associated with early-stage psychiatric symptom-level profiles.

- Validating these findings through downstream experimental work and independent clinical cohorts, with a particular focus on the Chinese Han population.
