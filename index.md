# About Me

<img src="https://hugolyu.github.io/honggang.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Honggang Lyu (Hugo, 吕洪港)**.

I am a Ph.D. Student (Year 2) majoring in **Psychiatry and Mental Health** at Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, supervised by [Prof. Zhongchun Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhongchun-Liu-2). My recent focus identifying the potential risk factors and objective biomarkers of psychiatric disorders from genetic perspective to optimize individualized medical interventions.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *honggang.lv[at]whu[dot]edu[dot]cn*

## Research Interests

> *&ensp;The rapid emergence of high-quality genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for common psychiatric disorders provide insights into for understanding their biological underpinnings. 
> <br> &ensp;However, mental illness manifests with remarkable clinical heterogeneity, with patients exhibiting diverse early clinical symptoms. For example, adolescent depression often presents with mood dysregulation, academic disengagement, and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors, while geriatric depression frequently involves somatic complaints. 
> <br>&ensp;Therefore, identifying potential risk factors and objective biomarkers specific to the early clinical profiles of common psychiatric disorders holds significant value for improving diagnosis and treatment of these debilitating conditions.*

- Conducting more large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for early psychiatric clinical symptoms-level. Leveraging large-scale biobanks like UKBiobank, to further elucidate genetic architecture underlying diverse psychiatric clinical symptoms-level profiles.

- Integrating multi-omics data (e.g., Transcriptomics, proteomics, single-cell and bulk RNA-seq) with cutting-edge statistical approaches (e.g., Mendelian Randomization, TWAS, PWAS, and gsMap) to accelerate the identification of potential risk factors and objective biomarkers for early-stage psychiatric symptoms-level profiles.

- Validating these findings through downstream experimental work and independent clinical cohorts, with a particular focus on the Chinese Han population.
